# Timer

This is a simple console timer with simple functionality to monitor your productivity.

```python
if volume_test
```
two beeps will test the current volume and frequency of the timer(s) sound when the script is launched.

## When started:

- Input the amount of time you want to wait expressed in minutes.

- CTRL+C to pause the timer and Y to resume.

- Input -1 if you want to express the amount of time in seconds.

- Input -2 and then a positive number n if you want to start a sequence of n identical timers.

- Wait until all your timers go off.
